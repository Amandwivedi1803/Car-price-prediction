# Car-price-prediction
A new car's price is established by the manufacturer, with the government incurring some additional costs in the form of taxes. Customers who buy a new car can rest assured that their money is being carefully spent. However, as new car prices rise and purchasers become unable to afford them, used car sales are on the rise all over the world. As a result, a method for estimating the value of a used car based on a variety of characteristics is urgently needed.So,a car price predication model is developed instead of estimating a car's price range, it will be possible to estimate the car's actual price. In addition, a user interface has been developed that takes user input and displays the pricing of an automobile based on that input.  Prediction of the price of a used car was developed. In the system, there are two basic phases:
1.	Training Phase: Using the data in the data set, the system is trained to fit a model (line/curve) depending on the algorithm selected.
2.	Testing Phase: The system is given inputs and its functionality is checked. The precision is tested. As a result, the data that is used to train or test the model must be appropriate. Because the system is intended to detect and estimate the price of a used car, distinct algorithms must be utilized for the two jobs. Different algorithms were compared for their accuracy before being picked for further use. The well-suited one for the task was chosen.
Information Preprocessing is the main stage and will be the essential advance before preparing for each model utilizing a technique.
Utilizing AI calculations and the Kaggle dataset, we endeavored to expect the selling cost of pre-owned vehicles. This dataset was anticipated utilizing Random Forest and Extra Tress Regressor.
